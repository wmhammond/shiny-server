<p>This page is presently under construction. The posted database is from Choat et al. (2012). We are preparing an updated and vastly expanded database (~4,500 P50 observations, ~1,600 species) for scientific publication, and it will be posted here as an open-access resource once the paper is published. Please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:williamhammond@ufl.edu">williamhammond@ufl.edu</a>&nbsp;with any questions.</p>
